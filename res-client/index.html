    <title>Motherblubing Website</title>

    <header>
        <h1>This is a motherblubing website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's blubing perfect.</aside>
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what the blub else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your stuff is special. 
You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you 
some blubing Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site.
 You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a good time
because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherbluber. Let me describe 
your perfect-stuff website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>stuff's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your stuffty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your stuffty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherbluber's accessible to every stuffhole that visits your site</li>
            <li>stuff's legible and gets your blubing point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, motherbluber:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this stuff. It's a 
motherblubing website. Why the blub do you need to animate a blubing 
trendy-stuff banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of stuff? You
 spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your blubing site, and some
 motherbluber jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will 
never see that stuff. Not to mention blind people will never see that 
stuff, but they don't see any of your stuffty stuff.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's blubing lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed 
facebook logo on your blubing Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 
100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the blubing background 
color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a stuffty webfont just so 
you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You 
piece of stuff.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You dumbstuff. You thought you needed media queries to be 
responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever 
motherblubing screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if 
you're on an iMac or a motherblubing Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It blubing works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this stuff. You can read it ... that is, if you can 
read, motherbluber. It makes sense. It has motherblubing hierarchy. It's
 using HTML5 tags so you and your cool-stuff browser know what the blub's
 in this blubing site. That's semantics, motherbluber.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the blubing screen. Your site has three 
bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full
 screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the 
jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherbluber in IE6. I blubing dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what
 his true natural state is, you have no blubing idea what a website is. 
All you have ever seen are stuffty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what 
should be text communicating a blubing message. This is a real, naked 
website. Look at it. It's blubing beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is blubing satire, you blub</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your stuffty site should look like 
this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are
 <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-nice-guy.</p>
